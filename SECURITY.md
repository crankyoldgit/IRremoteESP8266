# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the `master` branch of the library will receive security updates.
Security updates will **NOT** be applied to any previously published or released versions.

A new release version of the library will be published, _if required_, to address any security updates.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any _sensitive_, _critical_, or _urgent_ vulnerablities directly to _David Conran (david@xyzzy.com.au)_ **and** <a href="https://github.com/crankyoldgit/IRremoteESP8266/issues/new/choose">create an issue</a> saying you need to communicate an important security issue. i.e. _Sensitive_ details in the email, _General_ details in the Issue. Two different notification paths to help make sure it's seen.

After assessing the issue, we will work out how we will handle the matter and let you know how to proceed.

If the vulnerablity is neither _sensitive_, _critical_, or _urgent_, please just create a <a href="https://github.com/crankyoldgit/IRremoteESP8266/issues/new/choose">new issue</a> as per normal.

You _should_ receive an initial response with in **48** _(or so)_ hours typically.
You _should_ get updates on a security vulnerability report with in a week, probably much sooner.
This project is supported completely on a ad-hoc volounteer basis, and has only a handful of main contributers so there could be unforseen delays. e.g. Vacations etc.

If you don't hear from anyone with in _two weeks_ & you think you should have, it's probably safe to assume we have missed you're messages. Please try again, or via another method or channel.

We will endeavour to keep the issue reporter(s) in the loop as much as practical, and address the reported issue as soon as feasible.
