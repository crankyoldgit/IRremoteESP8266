## 2.0.0 - 2016/11/25
- Marcos Marinho marcosamarinho
- Fix SHARP ,changed results->data to LONG LONG to allow return 48 bits. 
- Fix SONY and included automatic repeat see MIN_REPEAT and now decoding command and address .
- Fix NEC and implement check integrity. 
- Fix SHARP .
- Fix SANYO ,now AIWA can be decoded too , AIWA_RC_T501 was disabled in IRremote.h as it is a so specific control .
- RC5/RC6 Clean up Debug and include VERBOSE as optional.
- PANASONIC 48 bits works now  see LONG LONG data Rawdata. 
- Implemented LG 32 bits and changed SAMSUNG to have the right decode based on Repeat times .
- Implemented dutycycle as variable see IRsend::enableIROut(int khz,int dutycycle)  .
- Changed all  DEBUG ,messages  to behavior as error to have a clear and nice output. 
- Included dump of ir times when DEBUG to easier troubleshooting .
- Changed the wait time to 80 miliseconds at timer to allow REPEAT treatment.
- Include the address and comand at decode process to all protocos we know . 
- Changed Rawdata decode to long long to allow decode larger numbers . 
- Split files as z30t0/IRremote and merge changes . 
- Created internal functions to simplify the code and to allow the code reuse. 
- Changed USECPERTICK  to 1 to allow have times in microseconds without trunc on integer .
- Created OFFSET_START to allow take the fake read value and keep compatibility with IRRemote
- Created generic functions to be used at client to allow no changes when implementing new protocols '
- Please change your code to use it as String to allow new protocols ...
-    bool send_raw    (String protocol, long long rawData, int bits) .  
-    bool send_address(String protocol, int address, int command, int bits).
