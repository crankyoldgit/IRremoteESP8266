# IRremote ESP8266 Library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/markszabo/IRremoteESP8266.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/markszabo/IRremoteESP8266)

This library enables you to **send and receive** infra-red signals on an ESP8266 using Arduino framework (https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino)

This library is based on Ken Shirriff's work (https://github.com/shirriff/Arduino-IRremote/)

[Mark Szabo](https://github.com/markszabo/IRremoteESP8266) has updated the IRsend class to work on ESP8266 and [Sebastien Warin](https://github.com/sebastienwarin/IRremoteESP8266) the receiving & decoding part (IRrecv class).

Seb's notes : I also changed the pulse parameters for Samsung, update the Panasonic and Samsung decoders and remove the SANYO decoders. The IR decoder was successfully tested with Panasonic and Samsung remote controls.
