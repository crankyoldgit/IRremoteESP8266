# IRremote ESP8266 Library

This library enables you to **send and receive** infra-red signals on an ESP8266 using Arduino framework (https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino)

This library is based on Ken Shirriff's work (https://github.com/shirriff/Arduino-IRremote/)

[Mark Szabo](https://github.com/markszabo/IRremoteESP8266) has updated the IRsend class to work on ESP8266 and [Sebastien Warin](https://github.com/sebastienwarin/IRremoteESP8266) the receiving & decoding part (IRrecv class).

Seb's notes : I also changed the pulse parameters for Samsung, update the Panasonic and Samsung decoders and remove the SANYO decoders. The IR decoder was successfully tested with Panasonic and Samsung remote controls.

Marcos Marinho's notes :Many improvements and changes are done at this new version,  Check.  [changelog.md](changelog.md)

To avoid changes at new versions use new functions so send IR . 

Use for 32 bits  larger protocols , need bits to allow generic protocols  . 

     send_address("PANASONIC",0x4004,0x100bcbd,48); 
     send_address("SANYO",0x1FC0,0x00,42); 

This two commands allows the same result. 

     send_address("NEC",0x20,0x10,32); 
     send_raw("NEC",0x20DF10EF,32) ; 

Others protocols use send_raw .
   
     send_raw("SONY",0x090,12) ;
     send_raw("JVC",0xf900,16) ;
             
Protocol number is decoded to String at results->protocol.
